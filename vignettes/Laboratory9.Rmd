# Introduction

We have already learnt the basics of sampling from a population using the `rstem` functions.

These are good for verifying, reproducing and sometimes investigating ideas where theory is intractable.

In practice, however, we often cannot assume a distribution for the population and must use distributional information latent within the sample. This information can be extracted using the `bootstrap`.

There are a number of very cool packages on `CRAN` that you can use to perform basic bootstrap as `EFRON` designed. Plus there are many more algorithms which implement different sampling schemes.

We will look at the R package `boot` and in the Lab we will design our own bootstrap functions.

# boot `install.packages("boot")`

In classical statistics we are confronted with the need to make estimates of parameters. These estimates come in two forms:-

>
  1. Point $\hat{\theta}$
  2. Interval $(L,U)$

Generally we make our point estimate directly from the sample and the interval estimate we can make in many ways. If we implement analytic confidence intervals (using a formula such as $\bar{Y} \pm t_{\alpha/2}s/\sqrt{n}$) then we use the originating sample. We can however use `bootstrap` methods which invoke resampling techniques.

## Example

Suppose we wish to make bootstrap interval estimates of the mean `LENGTH` by each of the three fish, Catfish, Bass, and Buffalo fish in the Tennessee river

```{r}
data(ddt)
library(ggplot2)
g <- ggplot(ddt, aes(x = SPECIES, y = LENGTH, fill = SPECIES)) + geom_boxplot()
g
```


To resample the data set we need to make a function that is suitable for the R package `boot`.

The function must have at least two arguments:

>
  1. data
  2. indices
  
  
The data is typically a data frame which will be given as the first argument of the `boot` function, and the indices will be supplied by the `boot` function.

Notice that you need to choose appropriate statistics. If you need to estimate the mean then the stat will be the sample mean.

The function must return a vector. Each will be referenced in the output by an index. For example the catfish will be referenced by a `1` and the Buffalo fish by a `3`.


```{r}
library(boot)
myfun <- function(data,indices){
  d<-data[indices,]
  dbarcat <- mean(with(d, d[SPECIES == "CCATFISH","LENGTH"]))
  dbarbas <- mean(with(d, d[SPECIES == "LMBASS", "LENGTH"]))
  dbarbuf <- mean(with(d, d[SPECIES == "SMBUFFALO", "LENGTH"]))
  return(c(dbarcat = dbarcat, dbarbas = dbarbas, dbarbuf = dbarbuf))
}



```

Notice that the boot function has three arguments (you can use more -- see `?boot`)

>
  1. data
  2. the user defined function as above
  3. the number of iterations, `R`
  

```{r}
out <-boot(ddt,myfun, R = 1000)
```


The output can then be used to calculate confidence intervals by using the `bootci()` function. Notice that the type of interval is `perc=percentage`. This will put $\alpha/2*100/1$% of the distribution in each of the tails.

```{r}
outci <- boot.ci(out, conf = 0.95, index = 1,type = "perc")
outci
```

### List output

There is a lot more in the output than you might think.

```{r}
names(out)
```

Also from the `boot.ci` function

```{r}
names(outci)
```


This information can be used for making graphical output.

### Plots

To see the simulation output we can use the plot function. Note that since the `class` of `out` is `boot` there is the possibility for the `boot` programmer to make an `S3` method. In fact there is a plot method. When the function `plot` inspects `out` it will see that its class is `boot` and then look for a method `plot.boot` if it finds it then it will call it.

The plot uses the matrix $t$ which contains the simulation.

```{r}
methods(class = "boot")
plot(out, index = 1) # this will call plot.boot

```


To view the confdence interval we can use the following

```{r}
ci = outci$percent[1,c(4,5)]
ci
```

```{r}
hist(out$t[,1], 
     main = "CCATFISH", 
     col = "green", 
     prob = TRUE,
     xlab = "sample mean")

lines(density(out$t[,1]), 
      lwd = 2,
      col = "red")

abline(v = ci, 
       col = "Blue", 
       lwd = 3)
```

# Finally

The lab will take you further and give you some excellent code to stimulate your understanding of the `bootstrap`.

Place the following files in their correct folders and complete the lab.

`r rmdfiles("Lab9", "Intro2R")`
